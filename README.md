Mini Wiki Project using MarkDown

## Make your own Wiki

This project is meant as a chance for you to practice using git flow and GitHub; it's
also a chance to introduce the project and classroom protocols that we will be using
on all the large-scale projects throughout the year.

While this is a much shorter project - roughly a week - you should get the full
'project feel' experience, beginning with ideation and ending with mini-project
presentations*.

NB: Making this a partner or small group project will allow the expansion of the
scope of the project requirements and will also give you more opportunities to
explore branching, merging, and versioning.

## Suggested Duration

~3-5 Days, depending on our needs

## Prompt

Let's combine what you've learned into a project! We are going to use the idea of 3
Minute Presentation Parties, in which participants create a 3-minute presentation
about anything they feel passionately about.

Instead of a presentation, you'll create a mini wiki using directories and markdown
files. You'll upload the whole thing to a GitHub repo so it can be viewed by others!
As far as the topic goes, the world is your oyster - this could be about your favorite
TV show, school culture, your most hated foods, or whatever you'd like to write
about, given the following project requirements.

## Project Requirements:

- The project should be housed in a new GitHub repository (Created by me in
GitHub Classroom)
- The ReadMe file should have a loose overview of your topic (Use Markdown)
- At least 3 subtopics, each in its own directory. At least two must have subtopics
included in their directories.
- Each directory needs a 'landing page' which will be a markdown file describing
that subtopic.

## Example:
Let's say you make a wiki about Dogs. Your main page project is just DOGS. Inside
that project, you could have three sub-directories: Dog Rankings, Herding Dogs,
and Toy Dogs. Maybe Dog Rankings just has a single markdown file with the list
of dogs, ranked. But Herding and Toy could each have subcategories for specific
breeds of dog, again, each with their own markdown file.

You may end up with a file system that looks something like this:

)

**Note: This is only meant to serve as an example of structure - your project would be
explorable and live inside of a GitHub repository.**

## Extensions

An easy extension is for you to just make more, but consider also having some
specifics in Markdown, such as adding images or links to make your project more
interesting.
